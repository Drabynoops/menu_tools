# menu_tools
Python library for creating command line menus (WIP)

This file was originally created for my online courses with Bellvue University through Guild Education paid for by Target.

TODOs: 
+ Create more customizable options for menus, currently the menus only work based on terminal size (columns)
+ Tests, tests, tests. Need to get into this habit.
+ Experiment with accepting mouse input to feel more like a "modern" program.
  1. If this causes a noticeable flickering of the screen, I might shelve this idea
